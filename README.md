This project is worked based on the video lecture on moodle page, it is created by using Thompson's Construction and Shunting Yard Algorithm..

What does the code do: 
1. Changes the infix regular expression into pofix regular expression which is easier for computer to work on.
2. And by using the pofix regular expression, it will compiles it into an NFA
3. The followes function allows the current set of the states to follow the E arrows
4. It then matches the strings with the infixes which the user input.
